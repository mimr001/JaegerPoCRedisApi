# JaegerPoCRedisApi
Part 2(3) of Jaeger PoC

Use together with the other parts to understand the PoC.
Note, it's likely enough to just browse the code here on GitHub and then simply run:
_docker stack deploy --compose-file Jaeger-stack.yml jaegerpoc_
(from part 1) towards your docker swarm of choice...
